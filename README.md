# Project-Managment
An app of lists, and the most polish app that I ever made. Enjoy!

My first big project in Python. A project managment app! 
Create lists of what you need, save them, and reuse them of you want!

The idea was to pull out all my knowledge of Python and make a modular
big app. Modular because I can upgrade and add more features, and big
because it is big compared to normal terminal apps.
